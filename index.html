                <p> Throughout my life, I had turned to golf as an 
                    enjoyment in my life. I would compete in tournaments 
                    and played in highschool all 4 years. This made me 
                    want to pursue a career in the golf inndustry. So i 
                    went down to South Carolina to work on getting 
                    <abbr title="Professional Golf Association">PGA</abbr> 
                    certified. After two years of doing that, I was realizing 
                    that the industry was not for me. So i moved to 
                    Amherst, MA to work and live with my girlfriend and take 
                    courses at <abbr title="Westfield State University">WSU</abbr>. </p>

                <h1>Past Work</h1>
                <p>When pursuing my career in the golf industry, 
                    I worked at multiple local golf courses, Shaker 
                    Hills and Butterbrook Country Club. At Shaker Hills 
                    I was a Cart Attendant and at Butterbrook I was a 
                    Ranger. When I moved to Amherst I worked at Insomnia 
                    Cookies as a delivery driver for 2.5 years. I then 
                    switched jobs to work at a very popular local pizza 
                    shop called Antonios pizza by the slice, where I 
                    would sometimes make the pizza but mostly serve the 
                    pizza. I did that for about 2 years.</p>

                    <h1>Web Developer</h1>
                    <p>The reason as to why I want to become a web developer, is mostly because I have found coding to be interesting and challenging, I like challenging work and being able to showcase my abilities, and I feel that this is a perfect platform to do so.</p>
